> A little project written in vuejs and tailwindcss to store sample components

## Why this project ?

The concept of this project was inspired to me by my friend [Louis Perdereau](https://github.com/lperdereau) because I am bad at frontend development so, this is more of a learning project.
This is also for me the opportunity to learn more about the Github environment as I am more used to Gitlab.

## Install

You can install the project's dependencies by running the following command.
```sh
npm install
```

You can also build a Docker image from the project's repository after cloning it.
```sh
docker build -t <your-image-tag> .
```

## Run tests

The project is setup to use Jest as unit testing framework and Cypress for e2e testing.
```sh
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e
```

## ü§ù Contributing

As this is more going to be a learning project than a real community project, I am not going to be super reactive on feature requests but any feedback/advice are welcomed !
